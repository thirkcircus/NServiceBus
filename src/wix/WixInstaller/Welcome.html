    <h2>NServiceBus</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to NServiceBus. This package contains set of tools, code samples and documentation
        designed to help you develop and build NServiceBus applications.</p>
    <p>
        For access to additional resources and information, such as downloads, forum posts,
        and extra documentation, go to the <a href="http://www.nservicebus.com">NServiceBus
            website.</a></p>
    <h3>
        The NServiceBus package contains the following items:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./Binaries">Binaries</a> - The NServiceBus binaries required to run NServiceBus.</li>
        <li><a href="./Tools/">Tools</a> - A series of useful tools for management of messages.</li>
        <li><a href="./Samples/">Samples</a> - Sample applications to get familiar on how to
            perform daily NServiceBus tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Tools description:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Tools/">ReturnToSourceQueue.exe</a></div>
            This tool sends messages from the error queue back to its original queue so that
            they can be processed again. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Tools/">XsdGenerator.exe</a></div>
            Allows you to take your message schema classes and generate an XSD that will allow
            developers on other platforms to use to send messages with (though those messages
            would likely be coming in over HTTP via the gateway). </li>
        <li>
             <div>
                 <a href="./Tools/licenseinstaller/">LicenseInstaller.exe</a></div>
             Utility for developers to install a NServiceBus license file into the registry. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Samples description:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/ErrorHandling/">Error Handling - With and without Second Level Retries</a></div>
            This sample demonstrates what happens when exceptions occur when messages are handled and how retries work. As a comparison, it also illustrates the behavior when the Second Level Retries (SLR) feature is turned off.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/FullDuplex/">Full Duplex - Request/Response</a></div>
            This sample illustrates the use of the request/response messaging pattern 
            with NServiceBus. What you'll see is how to define messages, how to specify the
            destination for a message, and how to send a message and how to handle the response. This sample also illustrates, configuration of custom logging using other log libraries such as NLog and setting up an unit of work pattern.
        </li>
	<li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/Gateway/">Gateway - Cross Site Communication</a></div>
            This sample demonstrates how logically different sites such as Headquarters, Stores communicate using the NServiceBus Gateway feature. This sample also demonstrates the use of the DataBus feature which enables in transferring large data. Data that needs to be transferred using the databus is defined using the DataBusProperty<T> as shown in Headquarter.Messages.PriceUpdated and the Headquarter endpoint has initialization code to setup the Databus. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/PubSub/">PubSub</a></div>
            This sample shows the use of publish subscribe messaging pattern using NServiceBus. This sample is
            also the "Getting Started" section of the documentation and shows polymorphic subscriptions
            as well as durable subscriptions for publisher fault-tolerance. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/ScaleOut/">ScaleOut - Scaling out using the Distributor</a></div>
            This sample illustrates the Scale out scenario using the Distributor. It highlights how the same endpoint can be run using different feature profiles (using NServiceBus.Master and NServiceBus.Worker) to facilitate scaling out when necessary without having to change code. To scale out, all is needed is to deploy the endpoint to a different server and run using the worker profile.</li>

<li>
<div>VideoStore</div>
This sample implements the following worflow of a fictional video store. Users can order videos from the website. Once orders are submitted, there is a window of time allocated for handling cancellations due to buyer's remorse. Once the order has been accepted, they are provisioned and made available for download. In implementing the above workflow various aspects are highlighted:<br> 
<br> <ul>
<li>The Sales endpoint illustrates the use of the Saga pattern to handle the buyer's remorse scenario. </li>
<li> 
The CustomerRelations endpoint illustrates how in-memory events (domain events pattern) can be defined and subscribed to.</li> 
<li>The request/response pattern is illustrated for the video provisioning between the ContentManagement endpoint and the Operations Endpoint.</li> 
<li>The ECommerce endpoint is implemented as an ASP.NET MVC4 application which uses SignalR to show feedback to the user.</li> 
<li>This sample also illustrates the use of Unobtrusive message conventions to let NServiceBus know in order to identify commands, events and messages defined as POCOs which avoids having to add a reference to the NServiceBus libraries in the message definition dlls.
</li>
<li>
The use of message headers and message mutator is also illustrated when the user clicks on the Check box on the ECommerce web page, which conveniently stops at the predefined breakpoints in the message handler code on the endpoints.
</li>
<li>
The use of encryption is illustrated by passing in the Credit Card number and the Expiration date from the ECommerce web site. The UnobtrusiveConventions defined in the ECommerce endpoint show how to treat certain properties as encrypted. Both the ECommerce and the Sales endpoint is setup for RijndaelEncryption and the encryption key is provided in the config file. If the messages are inspected in the queue, both the Credit Card number and the Expiration Date will show the encrypted values.  
</li>
<li>
The video store sample is implemented using different transports in each of the following solutions to highlight the necessary changes that need to be done in using each of these as the underlying message transport: <br> 
</li>

<br> <ul>
     <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/VideoStore.ActiveMQ/">VideoStore - Using ActiveMQ as the message transport</a></div>
            This sample illustrates the use of ActiveMQ as the message transport. Proper references for ActiveMQ are included. The endpoint is configured to use ActiveMQ as a transport. The app.config provides the necessary configuration needed to communicate to the ActiveMQ server.</li>
      <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/VideoStore.Msmq/">VideoStore - Using MSMQ as the message transport</a></div>
            This sample illustrates the use of MSMQ as the message transport. This is the default transport. This is no different in how endpoints were setup in 3.x versions.</li>
      <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/VideoStore.RabbitMQ/">VideoStore - Using RabbitMQ as the message transport</a></div>
            This sample illustrates the use of RabbitMQ as the message transport. Proper references for RabbitMQ are included. The endpoint is configured to use RabbitMQ as a transport. The app.config provides the necessary configuration needed to communicate to the RabbitMQ server.</li>
      <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/VideoStore.SqlServer/">VideoStore - Using SQL Server as the message transport</a></div>
            This sample illustrates the use of SQLServer broker as the message transport. Proper references for SQLServer are included. The endpoint is configured to use SQLServer as a transport. The app.config provides the necessary configuration needed to communicate with SQL Server.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
